# SIMA Technical Spec v0

## Implementation

- Language: Go.
- Distribution target: single `sima` binary.
- Repository: standalone private tool repo.
- User projects receive `.sima/` runtime state via `sima init`.

## Project-local layout

```text
.sima/
  personal/
    memory/{cards,candidates,archive}/
    skills/{active,candidates}/
    runs/
    briefs/
    evidence/
  team/
    memory/{cards,candidates,archive}/
    skills/{active,candidates}/
  system/
    skills/
    prompts/
  config.yaml
  schema.yaml
```

## Backend profiles

SIMA must support multiple Claude Code/Codex installations and configs on the same machine. Backends are named profiles in `.sima/config.yaml`:

```yaml
backends:
  claude-main:
    kind: claude-code
    executable: /opt/homebrew/bin/claude
    config_path: ~/.claude/settings.json
  codex-work:
    kind: codex
    executable: ~/bin/codex-work
    config_path: ~/.codex-work/config.toml
```

Commands:

```bash
sima backend list
sima backend add <name> --kind <claude-code|codex> --executable <path>
sima backend doctor <name>
```

## SDD support

SIMA treats spec-driven-development artifacts as first-class source artifacts:

- product specs, technical specs, OpenSpec changes, and implementation plans are preserved as evidence/source material;
- `brief` should extract constraints, acceptance criteria, open questions, and verification gates;
- SIMA should not save whole specs as active memory;
- after execution, SIMA should learn only durable decisions, invariants, gotchas, guardrails, anti-patterns, or reusable skills with evidence pointers back to specs.

## Archivist contract

The archivist must run in a clean separate process/session from the worker. It receives bounded evidence only:

- original task;
- pre-task brief;
- diff;
- logs;
- verification results;
- worker report;
- proposed memory/skill changes;
- relevant existing memory/skills.

It emits structured decisions: `apply`, `reject`, or `defer`.

## Safety

Auto-apply only personal/local proposals with:

- valid schema;
- evidence;
- no unresolved conflict;
- clean archivist approval;
- no reward-hacking/destructive shortcut flags.
